Q:Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
A: DriverPass was the client, they needed a system to allow driving students to take practice test, schedule driving lessons, and watch edcational content while allowing the system administrators make changes and have access to the system. 

Q:What did you do particularly well?
A:I think I excelled at the object model diagrams. I understood the reltionships and defined them pretty well.

Q:How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
A:I attempted to design a user role based system the same way the schools setup their online system by allowing the administrators to also have access to the student pages too. I did this not only for testing but also to allow the adminstrators to see the students side too.

Q:How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
A: I try to find a similar design that can be tweaked to the system that it needs to apply to. I like to choose tried and proven solutions to solve my problems.
